# Seagull Saftey

A project created for ART101 by Group 2

## Purpose

Seagull Saftey exists to raise awareness for the crucial part seagulls play in our ecosystem.
We generally look upon seagulls (and gulls of all kinds) as pests in California, but the truth is they have much more going on inside them than we know.
In this interactive demo, you can explore the different body parts of seagulls, and what functions they serve.
You can also click on a node/part to be redirected to websites to learn more about it.
